Setting up a local env for wp might take time so here is a quick info on place where u can make changes to the site directly.

1. CSS
 
GO to (https://www.earthhour.sg/wp-admin/customize.php)[https://www.earthhour.sg/wp-admin/customize.php], to add any css styles to any part of the site. (including openletter, homepage, maps etc). There is no need to PR.


2. JS

Different features are built with different JS libraries

openletter is built with vuejs 

maps feature uses custom jQuery code.
